          <h1 class="headings">Website Design</h1>
          <p>
            Website design is the process of planning and creating the visual
            layout, structure, and functionality of a website. It involves
            combining elements like color schemes, typography, navigation, and
            graphics to create an aesthetically pleasing and user-friendly
            experience. Good website design not only looks great but also
            ensures ease of use, accessibility, and responsiveness across
            devices. It plays a crucial role in conveying a brand’s identity,
            engaging users, and achieving business goals by making content easy
            to find and interact with.

          <h1 class="headings">UX/UI Design</h1>
          <p>
            UI (User Interface) and UX (User Experience) design focus on
            enhancing the interaction between users and a product or website. UI
            design deals with the look and feel of the interface—like buttons,
            layout, and visual elements—while UX design focuses on the overall
            experience, ensuring that the design is intuitive, easy to navigate,
            and meets user needs. The goal of UI/UX design is to create
            seamless, engaging, and functional digital experiences that keep
            users satisfied and encourage them to return.

          <h1 class="headings">Digital Marketing</h1>
          <p>
            Digital marketing is the use of online platforms and digital
            technologies to promote products or services. It includes tactics
            like social media marketing, search engine optimization (SEO),
            content marketing, email campaigns, and paid advertising. Digital
            marketing allows businesses to reach a wider audience, track
            engagement, and refine strategies based on data-driven insights. By
            leveraging various online channels, digital marketing helps build
            brand awareness, increase customer engagement, and drive conversions
            in the digital age.
